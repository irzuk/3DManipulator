## Manipulator 

Manipulator on the movable platform that is based on Arduino. Controlled by hand gestures with a help of a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer. Have a 3D digital twin also shows the  distance to the object in front of the robot.
The platform, manipulator and glove are connected to the control computer by Java.
